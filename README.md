# Random Password Generator

With this project I have modified starter code to create an application that enables users to generate random passwords based on criteria that theyâ€™ve selected. Utilizing Javascript, when the "generate password" button is clicked, the user will be guided through a series of prompts that will allow them to set the length of their password, and the types of criteria they want to include. Once they have selected all their criteria, a randomly generated password will appear in the text box in the center of the page.
