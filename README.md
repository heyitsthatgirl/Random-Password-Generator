# Random Password Generator

With this project I have modified starter code to create an application that enables users to generate random passwords based on criteria that they’ve selected. Utilizing Javascript, when the "generate password" button is clicked, the user will be guided through a series of prompts that will allow them to set the length of their password, and choose the types of characters they want to include. Once they have selected all of their criteria, a randomly generated password will appear in the text box in the center of the page.
